# Leetcode Problems

This is the solution of leetcode problems.

Note: Please use this code only for guidance or if you feel you can't do the problem anymore. Just copying the code doesn't make you better. Even after seeing the code, you should understand and see the logics and ways I used to solve the problem. This will give you a new perspective. Also, I recommend you to read through my codes even if you already solve the problems since mine way may differ from you, which will give you new perspective and view of solving problems.

The problems are solved using Python language.

The code you will write on the leetcode is the code written between """ The code starts here.""" and """ The code ends here.""".
